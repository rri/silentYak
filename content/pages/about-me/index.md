My name is Ramnath Iyer and I live in Bellevue, WA, with my wife [Anu Sharma](https://anu.sh/). I
enjoy outdoor activity like hiking (like most Pacific Northwesterners), and I love reading
non-fiction and technical books. I am a huge fan of that most excellent endangered beverage known as
"coffee" /ˈkɒf.i/.

By trade, I am a software professional, currently employed at Amazon
[Kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper). Of course, any
views expressed on this website are my own, not my employer's, as is any work showcased here.

I enjoy working with large-scale software systems, and have an interest in artificial intelligence,
programming language theory, metaprogramming, mathematics, operating systems, provable security,
theoretical physics, literature and philosophy. But mostly, I like tinkering with stuff and solving
stubborn problems.

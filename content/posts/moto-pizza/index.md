Yesterday, Anu and I were out with friends in the vicinity of Seattle downtown, and we discovered
this excellent pizza restaurant called MOTO Pizza. It's a hidden gem to be sure, not easy to find
when you're walking by. Great Detroit-style deep dish pizza (with many vegetarian options), along
with a cool ambiance.

From what I can tell [from their website](https://motopizza.com/moto-history/), they only started
operations post-2020 (*The Great Pandemic* of the 21st century) beginning with their West Seattle
location, and now have 5 stores with 2 more "coming soon". That sounds great --- they even have a
Bellevue Square store --- but I sometimes worry about cafes and restaurants, especially the good
ones, expanding too fast, then discovering that they can't carry the risk of inflation, economic
slowdown, or any cooling of customer interest.

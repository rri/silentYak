As we get older and gain more experience, the one thing we get better at, I think, is learning not
to react to the world around us as readily. Recently, I was reminded of the idea that this is a
mindset that we choose to adopt --- we are either *responsive* or *reactive* to situations.
Responsive is good; reactive is bad. Responsive means that we've taken a moment to digest external
input and formulate a line of action. Reactive, on the other hand, implies a lack of intentionality
on our part.

But I like to think of it thus:

> To think before you (re)act is wisdom; to refrain from action altogether is Zen.

The root of the idea is this: nothing is ever as bad as it seems, and nothing is ever as good as it
seems. In fact, facets of the same situation may simultaneously be better **and** worse than
expected. Not only is the future unpredictable, it is also a continuous flow of moments, not a
discrete set of milestones that we win or lose. All of this is summarized pithily in the Persian
adage, *"...and this, too, shall pass"*.

But I'm not suggesting that we give up on our wants. Rather, I have found it to be true (more often
than not) that taking **no** action is the quickest and most effective path to getting what you
want, and all your actions or reactions, though well-intentioned, only tend to get in the way. Have
you ever had the experience of working hard every single day, never taking a break because you're
worried that everything will fall apart if you do, and then one day you finally take a vacation for
three weeks, and disconcertingly what happens is...nothing at all --- everyone carries on just fine?
In a similar vein, things that seem like huge problems often melt away; the *real* problems are the
ones that come out of left field.

To avoid taking action requires a great deal of patience, and to be patient, one needs boundless
optimism that all the right things *will* magically happen, that the universe *will* conspire to
help you, and that everything *will* fall into place.

Be unreasonably optimistic.

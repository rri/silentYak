Lake 22 is another short and easy hike, an hour and twenty minutes away from Bellevue. It is a
roundtrip of 5.4 miles with an elevation gain of 1,350 feet. The toughest thing about this hike was
finding parking --- it turned out to be surprisingly busy at 8:30am, and we ended up parking half a
mile away from the trailhead. In fact, it was so busy initially that we had a large group of people
blocking our path ahead on the trail and I started regretting my choice of hike. But fortunately, we
managed to break through the crowd and sprint ahead.

This might be a bit of a quirk, but when it's just us, Anu and I prefer to get to the turnaround
point of the hike as quickly as possible. We might take a break every couple of miles to have a few
sips of water, but we seldom pause to take in the sights or take photos. No, all that must wait
until the return journey.

Lake 22 offers a pleasant view with calm waters. There's actually some snow and ice on the mountain
across the lake, which reflects on the surface of the water. There are some gorgeous views of the
landscape along the trail. You also pass by several gushing waterfalls. Quite a few old tree trunks
lie along the route.

I quite enjoyed seeing the diverse flora along the trail. The most interesting of the lot is
a orange-and-yellow wildflower called 'Western columbine' (*aquilegia formosa*). That's the one on
the right, below. I also noticed some wonderfully polished rocks that absolutely deserved to be
photographed.

Overall, our parking situation added an extra mile for us to walk, but I'm not sure if that ought to
count as part of the hike.

Today, we drove a little further out, to Longmire near Mount Rainier, to hike the Rampart Ridge Loop
trail. This is another easy trail with a total length of 5.28 miles and elevation gain of 1,456 feet
(if you return via the Wonderland trail as we did, instead of doubling back). The peace and quiet
during the hike was absolutely worth the 2-hour drive it took us to get there. In fact, we
encountered no one else during this hike except for a couple of people at the very end. I rather
enjoyed this communion with nature, punctuated with conversations on random topics like speculative
science.

Although, we were promised excellent views of Mount Rainier, we came across none, or perhaps we
missed it behind the clouds. It's ironic that Mount Rainier is ever present and easy to spot from
Seattle and Bellevue, but much harder to find when we're right at its foot.

The trail had a number of quaint little bridges over small streams, one of which seemed extremely
rickety. The national park has some spectacular trees, and this trail is no exception.

I found some specimens of 'Common Beargrass' (*xerophyllum tenax*), 'Devil's Club' (*oplopanax
horridus*), and 'Cascade Oregon-grape' (*berberis nervosa*) along the way.

On the way back, we stopped at Narada Falls. This waterfall flows into the Paradise river, which
runs parallel to the Nisqually river and eventually joins it.

We got some coffee and soda at the Elbe Market Country Store. There are several statues of Bigfoot
in front of and around the store. The light blue waters of Alder Lake by the road here was quite a
sight to behold.

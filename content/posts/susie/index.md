I am thrilled and excited to welcome **Susie** into our home!

Susie is a rich brown Bengal kitten, born on May 10<sup>th</sup> of this year. She quickly figured
out what's what, zoomed around to explore all the nooks and crannies (she's quite a blur), and most
importantly kept [Hobbes](@/posts/hobbes/index.md) at bay by hissing and snarling at him, even as he
persisted in chasing after her (very cautiously) trying to make her feel welcome.

Susie is named after Calvin's nemesis --- but Hobbes knows they secretly like each other.

Today's hike was to Poo Poo Point. Anu and I thought this was going to be a 7.2 mile hike with an
elevation gain of 1,748 feet, but it turned out this one was on the *Chirico trail*, which *also*
leads to Poo Poo Point but is only a 3.8 mile roundtrip with an elevation gain of 1,760 feet. Still,
that kind of distance and elevation gain is nothing to pooh pooh. Besides, we ended up walking a
total of 6 miles by continuing past Poo Poo Point...not realizing that we had, in fact, already
reached our intended turn-back point.

Paragliders use this area for their amusement. In fact, we saw a paraglider descending onto the open
field at the start of our hike. At the very top, the ground falls off eerily; it is a launch point
for paragliders.

I discovered the beautiful Red Baneberry (*actaea rubra*) along the trail. These are the
purple-leafed plants in the picture below. I also discovered, to my amazement, that the Devil's Club
(*oplopanax horridus*) has red berries that look a *lot* like those of the Red-berried Elder
(*sambucus racemosa*). Of course, the giant leaves give it away.

As we started walking into the forest, it occurred to me that it's incredibly difficult to capture
the essence of such an experience with a photograph. The precise amount of light, shade and
contrast, the feeling of spaces wide open, the smells and sights of the vegetation --- these are
well-nigh impossible to replicate visually in any meaningful sense. As a bonus, we found a Pacific
Banana Slug (*ariolimax columbianus*) that cheerfully posed for a portrait.

[Woodland Park Zoo](https://www.zoo.org/) was a good place to be yesterday, with Seth Meyers
performing his standup comedy show in an open-air setting. I like Seth Meyers --- his comedy is
light-hearted and fun, in this case focusing on his family and what it's like to be a New Yorker, a
husband, and a dad with three young kids.

Next time we do something like this, we should remember to carry our own chairs --- it's more
comfortable than sitting on the grass.

We saw a bunch of flamingos on the way out.

**P. S.** It's pretty cool that Woodland Park Zoo has the "zoo.org" domain...

So --- funny story.

I was walking down the road the other day, and boom! my **optimix.dev** website on [Digital
Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) stopped working. Shocking, right?

Ok, it wasn't a *complete* surprise...I *was* sending some commands to the server.

What do you mean, "Was it serious?". I was just tweaking it a bit, you know.

Alright, I *guess* you could call an Ubuntu 17--22 OS upgrade "serious". I mean, black holes and
neutron stars are certainly serious. Are OS upgrades really on the same level? I suppose it's all
very subjective.

Backup. Backup. That word sounds familiar, but if you keep repeating it, it starts to sound strange
and unfamiliar. Backup. Fun fact --- this concept of repetition causing a word or phrase to lose its
meaning for the listener temporarily is called *semantic satiation*.

Oh well.

One of my principles in life is that when someone hands you your cup of coffee, you take a sip
*immediately*. You don't wait (until it cools, until you sit down, etc.). One sip. Now, not later.
And of course, this principle extends to all beverages.

What this one sip gives you is peace of mind. No matter what random event causes you to spill your
beverage after that, you can rest in the knowledge that you've already had at least a sip, and no
one can take that experience away from you.

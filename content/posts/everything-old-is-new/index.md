I started reading [The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) series back
in 2008, in my early heady days of joining Amazon as a college hire. I was spurred on by colleagues
who seemed to care a lot about these books. More than an interest in fantasy fiction[^1], I think it
was my desire to keep up with them that convinced me to slog through all eleven books available at
the time. That was just in time for [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com) to take
over writing the remaining three books in the series. I was happy to see that the plot picked up
pace, and soon it was all over.

I don't think I was thrilled by the ending; it didn't offer quite the release and satisfaction I was
expecting after its final crescendo. But Sanderson managed to complete the ginormous feat of making
the story *move* and guiding it to its destination despite the hundreds of plot threads weighing it
down, and one must thank him for that.

I don't recall much of the actual plotlines or characters (except for the few that turn up in the
last three books of the series, which I've re-read a few times since). It's funny how memory works
like that --- I recall the *idea* of reading the books, but the very concrete experience I must have
had then has somehow morphed into an abstract concept in my memory. I don't think it's shelved away;
I think all the juice that could be extracted from it has been consumed, and the pomace has been
discarded. All that is left is a lingering flavor.

Blogging was of great interest to me until the year 2007, after which my interest waned, never quite
enough to shut it all down, but also leaving me without much of anything to say. I "restarted" my
blog every year or two with a promise of writing more about something. I realize now that the
problem wasn't that I didn't have anything interesting to say, but that I worried about who my
readers were and what they would think of it...and I found this situation unmotivating. Later, I had
the idea of creating a blog focused on technical matters, called **technoYak**. This didn't go
anywhere, but then I created another blog with a similar focus called
[**optimix**](https://optimix.dev) which was great fun for a while. The big idea here was to write
about anything, big or small, that I had personally built or experimented with, like a working
implementation of an algorithm or a problem whose solution I had figured out. But the problem of
motivation never quite went away, and content on the blog grew at a glacial pace.

But no more. For reasons I don't understand --- perhaps it has to do with my recent binge-watching
of [Andor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20603322) --- I feel energized once again by the idea of
writing down my thoughts, ideas and most important of all, *experiences*. In essence, it is our
experiences that give meaning to our consciousness, and it seems apt for them to be shared with the
universe.

In a sense, I am back where I started, and that's fantastic. I've decided to start blogging here
again, merging my **optimix** blog into this one as well. I haven't ported anything over from
earlier though, nor do I intend to...except for my [reading list](/pages/reading-list). I now use a
[static website](https://optimix.dev/2023/12/23/static-website/) built using
[Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), but the theme is very retro --- it has much of the same
look that my blog used to have back in 2007!

So welcome back once again, and happy reading & sharing! ðŸ¤“

[^1]: Despite my purported love of fantasy fiction novels, I believe I have only ever read one other
    series of that genre: *The Farseer Trilogy* by Robin Hobb, which was wonderfully written but
    devastatingly tragic.

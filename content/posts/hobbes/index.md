I am thrilled and excited to welcome **Hobbes** into our home!

Hobbes is a snow white Bengal kitten, born on April 15<sup>th</sup> of this year. His first order of
business coming home was to explore all areas on the main level and find himself a few cozy spots.

Hobbes is named after Calvin's bosom buddy and everyone's favorite tiger.

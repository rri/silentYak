Today's hike was a relatively easy one, 5.6 miles roundtrip with 1,585 feet elevation gain, with the
trailhead along the I-90 corridor. This is, of course, the **Teneriffe Falls Trail** --- not to be
confused with the **Mount Teneriffe Trail**, which begins at the same trailhead but continues for 13
miles all the way up to the summit.

The waterfall at the top was a relatively calm one. In fact, it was only on the way back that we
discovered it had even been in plain view about half a mile before getting the top, and both Anu and
I had completely missed it on the way up. Perhaps we had been too engrossed in our conversation then.

We picked and ate some salmonberries (*rubus spectabilis*) on the way down. The yellow ones taste a
tad like tomato. We did **not** eat any of the red-berried elder (*samucus racemosa*) --- they are
poisonous if eaten raw! We found a good deal of purple foxglove (*digitalis purpurea*) that added to
the natural beauty of the woods.

For a while now, I'd been meaning to make my home "smarter", i.e., more sensor-driven. Although I
already had several "smart" devices, my goal was to switch from various closed ecosystems (e.g.,
Alexa, Philips) to a unified and *open* ecosystem, one that I could tinker with using free (as in
*libre*) and open-source software. It's important to me that my data remain entirely on my own
devices and within my control. Moreover, I don't want personal data going to the "cloud", unless
it's for a purpose that I've requested by signing up for a service. In June, I decided to take the
plunge, and purchased a [Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/) server, which
offers a simple plug-n-play solution for home automation. Home Assistant is a project from the [Open
Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/), sponsored by [Nabu
Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com/)[^1]. I bundled my Home Assistant server with the
[SLZB-07](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-07/) antenna, a USB dongle that supports Zigbee, Matter,
and Thread protocols. Plug these in and hook up your server to your network with an Ethernet cable,
and you're ready to get started on a never-ending home automation journey.

![Home Assistant](home-assistant.webp "Home Assistant")

We have an [eero Pro 6](https://eero.com/shop/eero-pro-6) mesh Wi-Fi system at home. One of its
Ethernet ports is connected to a HoneyWell Thermostat ([Prestige IAQ with
RedLINK](https://www.honeywellhome.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/programmable-thermostats/prestige-iaq-kit-with-redlink-and-eim-ythx9421r5085ww-u/))
that controls a heat pump for heating and cooling. I connected its second Ethernet port --- each
eero device provides only two Ethernet ports ğŸ¤¯ --- to the Home Assistant server, and reserved an
IPv4 address `192.168.5.1` for it in my eero's DHCP server configuration.

I also have a Gentoo Linux server (*combinatrix.cloud*) with a reserved IPv4 address of
`192.168.4.99` running on a Beelink SER5 Mini PC (32GB RAM, 500GB M.2 SSD, AMD Ryzen 5800H). This
would continue to serve as a base for my home network, and host any additional compute-intensive
services I might need. (As an aside, I ended up re-installing Gentoo along the way, with some
improvements like [dark mode](@/posts/dark-mode-on-i3/index.md) and [port
knocking](@/posts/port-knocking/index.md).)

My final network looks like the diagram below.

{{ borderless() }}
![Home Networking](home-networking.svg "Home Networking")

I hooked up one camera ([REOLINK Duo 3 16MP UHD Dual-Lens
PoE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM39K7CB), outside the front door) to a [PoE+
injector](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BK4W8TQ), which in turn is connected to an eero satellite.
The advantage of PoE (Power over Ethernet) is its simplicity; you only need one cable for power
*and* networking, and you get a reliable connection to the router. Another camera ([REOLINK Smart 4K
UHD Pan & Tilt Wi-Fi 6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z841XYD), in the living room, used to see what
[Hobbes](@/posts/hobbes/index.md) is up to) is connected to the network wirelessly and powered by a
USB-C cable.

Most "smart" bulbs, switches and plugs are connected to the Home Assistant directly via Zigbee or
Matter. I have several [Aqara Zigbee Door & Window](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D37VDM3) sensors
working, but these are largely a disappointment: extremely hard to detect and setup out of the box,
especially without an Aqara brand hub. A few devices ([YoLink Water Leak
Sensors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCT7TH98), Hubspace Light Switch, [Dreo Air
Circulator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTCWLV35) and [Space
Heater](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNZH8SPG), and control of the HoneyWell Thermostat mentioned
earlier) are managed via cloud services (and require an Internet connection). This is, of course,
sub-optimal, as I'd wanted to avoid dependencies on third-party cloud services, but I don't have an
alternative for these at the moment. We have a projector ([Epson Home Cinema
4010](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082QMXBLK)) in the media room that I wanted to control through Home
Assistant. This particular projector model does not ship with a wireless module, but does work with
one that's manufactured exclusively by Epson and sold separately; however, I decided it was better
to simply purchase another eero satellite and connect the projector to it with an Ethernet cable. In
my earlier attempts to work around the limitation, I had tried to connect the projector to a spare
wireless router (also using Ethernet), but it is apparently impossible to have these routers operate
in "bridge" mode through Wi-Fi, so I would either have to somehow connect the spare router to
another Ethernet access point anyway, or operate a second wireless access point besides the eero
mesh (I opted for neither).

## Smart Bulbs

With the Zigbee antenna attached to my Home Assistant server, I was able to eliminate the need for a
Philips Hue Bridge, and connect the server to my light bulbs directly. To do this, you first need to
reset the bulbs, by removing them from your account using the Philips Hue mobile app (which requires
the Philips Hue Bridge). The bulbs are then in a ready-to-be-set-up mode. In my case, the light
bulbs got set up just fine, but I messed around with Zigbee channel configurations to the point of
breaking the Zigbee network completely, and had to reset all my bulbs individually a second time.
The Internet has a lot of suggestions on how to accomplish this, but the only method that worked is
this: hold a Philips dimmer switch next to each bulb, press and hold the 'On' and 'Off' buttons
simultaneously for a few seconds until the bulb flashes, then physically turn power to the bulb off
and back on.

## Water Leak Sensors

Last year in May, we had a water leak incident caused by a faulty washer-dryer installation that
ended up costing us a ridiculous amount of hassle and money (most of the latter was taken care of by
insurance, fortunately). After this incident, I purchased a dozen water leak sensors by
YoLink and placed them in various vulnerable locations. The
sensors are controlled by a central YoLink hub that's connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi. YoLink's
water leak sensors have been an excellent investment so far, having alerted me to water leaks (via
the YoLink app) on multiple occasions, including several leaky shut-off valves under the sink and
wash-basin --- hot water keeps loosening the valves --- and a dishwasher connection that was poorly
installed *twice* by the contractor performing the water damage restoration...talk about irony.

## Video Recording

While the REOLINK cameras were good enough for live viewing, I needed something more to detect
entities in the field of view and record footage when required. Instead of using a microSD card (or
REOLINK's cloud service), I set up [Frigate](https://docs.frigate.video) on my Gentoo server. The
Frigate installation uses [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) containers that you can run with
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) (I preferred the latter, and it
ended up being slightly complicated on Gentoo, especially for executing containers as a non-root
user using [OpenRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRC)). Now for some gory details.

### Mosquitto Configuration

Frigate depends on an [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) server (in this case, provided by [Eclipse
Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) to publish events on topics that Home Assistant can subscribe
to. Its configuration, shown below, lives in `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`. Mosquitto is absurbly
hard to debug, so it is best to stick to careful changes to the example configuration file. For one
thing, the sequence in which configuration is specified matters, and the TLS configuration
(`keyfile`, `certfile`, `cafile`) will most definitely break if it isn't specified *before* the
`listener` configuration.

```plaintext
allow_anonymous false
keyfile /data/tls/combinatrix.cloud.privkey.pem
certfile /data/tls/combinatrix.cloud.cert.pem
cafile /data/tls/combinatrix.cloud.chain.pem
log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto.log
log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_type information
connection_messages true
log_timestamp true
log_timestamp_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S
retain_available true
set_tcp_nodelay false
sys_interval 10

listener 8883
protocol mqtt
autosave_interval 1800
persistence true
persistence_file mosquitto.db
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/
password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile
```

Also note that we have [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) [TLS
certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ssl-certificate/) stored in `/data/tls`, and a password
file specified on the last line --- the latter needs to be created with a command like the one below
(`mqtt_user` is the existing system user for mosquitto):

```bash
mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile mqtt_user
```

### Frigate OpenRC Script

This is the OpenRC init script at `/etc/init.d/frigate`. Frigate uses MQTT, 
for which I set up an Eclipse Mosquitto server locally on my Gentoo
instance as discussed in the previous section. Notice that I have several passwords stashed away in
`/data/pwd` and Let's Encrypt TLS certificates stored in `/data/tls`. The most interesting (and
frustrating) tweak that ended up being required here is the "timeout" command before attempting to
start the container: I needed a hack to wait until the network was accessible before starting the
container process, lest it balk and die on me silently.

```bash
#!/sbin/openrc-run

user="frigate"
group="automation"
pidfile="/run/frigate.pid"

depend() {
  need net podman mosquitto
}

clean() {
  sudo -u "${user}" podman stop -i frigate 2>&1 >> /var/log/frigate.log
  sudo -u "${user}" podman rm -i frigate 2>&1 >> /var/log/frigate.log
  if [ -f "${pidfile}" ]
  then
    rm -f "${pidfile}"
  fi
}

start() {
  ebegin "Starting ${SVCNAME}"
  clean
  local mqtt_pass rtsp_pass
  mqtt_pass=$(cat /data/pwd/mqtt_user.passwd)
  rtsp_pass=$(cat /data/pwd/rtsp.passwd)

stop() {
  ebegin "Stopping ${SVCNAME}"
  clean
  eend $?
}
```

### Frigate Configuration

Frigate's own configuration is in a file called `config.yaml`, as shown below. The most interesting
bit here is the use of a `coral` detector --- a [Coral AI USB
Accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator) "Tensor Processing Unit" or TPU that can be
plugged into a USB port and used to offload model inference from the server.

One final note - the Coral AI USB Accelerator is a tricky beast. When plugged in, it shows up as one
device ("Global Unichip Corp"), and later morphs into another device after its first inference
("Google Inc"). Nobody knows why. You likely need the following
[udev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev) rules in `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-coral.rules` along with a
kernel restart.

```bash
# Coral USB before initialization (Global Unichip Corp)
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a6e", ATTRS{idProduct}=="089a", MODE="0664", TAG+="uaccess"

# Coral USB after initialization (Google Inc)
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="18d1", ATTRS{idProduct}=="9302", MODE="0664", TAG+="uaccess"
```

## DNS

To enable access to Home Assistant from anywhere over the Internet, I have an NGINX proxy running as
an addon on the Home Assistant server and my registrar [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)'s DNS servers
mapping my domain name (*automatix.dev*) to this server. But the server is behind an IPv4 NAT and an
IPv6 firewall on the eero gateway, so I need several additional fixes. First, I need holes punched
through the NAT and firewall in my eero configuration. Second, I need Let's Encrypt certificates for
the *automatix.dev* domain. Finally, I need a script on Home Assistant to call the Porkbun API
(which must be explicitly enabled on their website!) and dynamically update both my A (IPv4) and
AAAA (IPv6) records to reflect whatever has been assigned by my ISP. Within my network, I need to do
this on every device separately, even though all devices have the same external IPv4 address, they
do have distinct IPv6 addresses. Updating Home Assistant involves, in a nutshell, adding the
following to `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
rest:
  - resource: "https://api.ipify.org"
    scan_interval: 300  # Check every 5 minutes
    sensor:
      - name: "Current IPv4 Address"
        unique_id: "current_ipv4_address"
        value_template: "{{ value }}"
        icon: "mdi:ip-network"
        
  - resource: "https://api6.ipify.org"
    scan_interval: 300  # Check every 5 minutes
    sensor:
      - name: "Current IPv6 Address"
        unique_id: "current_ipv6_address"
        value_template: "{{ value }}"
        icon: "mdi:ip-network"

# REST commands for Porkbun API calls
rest_command:
  porkbun_update_ipv4:
    url: "https://api.porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns/editByNameType/{{ domain }}/A/{{ subdomain }}"
    method: POST
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload: '{"secretapikey": "{{ porkbun_secret_key }}", "apikey": "{{ porkbun_api_key }}", "content": "{{ ip }}", "ttl": "300"}'
    verify_ssl: true
  porkbun_update_ipv6:
    url: "https://api.porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns/editByNameType/{{ domain }}/AAAA/{{ subdomain }}"
    method: POST
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload: '{"secretapikey": "{{ porkbun_secret_key }}", "apikey": "{{ porkbun_api_key }}", "content": "{{ ip }}", "ttl": "300"}'
    verify_ssl: true
```

Secrets are enumerated in the `secrets.yaml` file.

```yaml
porkbun_api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
porkbun_secret_key: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

Finally, the REST commands above are invoked as part of automations listed in `automations.yaml`.

```yaml

```

The DNS story is not over yet and I had one last "tweak under my sleeve" as [Barry
Kripke](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Kripke) would say. Since most of the
connectivity between the Home Assistant server and Gentoo server were within the local area network
and *not* accessible over the Internet, I needed a way to have the DNS server map addresses
differently based on whether the requester was within my network or outside my network. Happily,
this was easy --- I had already set up [AdGuard
Home](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/adguard/) as a local DNS server on my Home
Assistant server and updated eero's DHCP server to assign it as the primary DNS server for all
devices on the network. So it was easy enough to declare custom A and AAAA records to be served for
*automatix.dev* and *combinatrix.cloud* that would be picked up (only) within my network.

[^1]: Nabu Casa also offers a commercial product called 'Home Assistant Cloud'...which I don't need.
    Happily, with Home Assistant, I have the freedom to ignore it and set everything up exactly as I
    want.

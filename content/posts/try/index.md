> I wrote this poem circa 2012, about 13 years ago. I think *Try* is about reconciling the messiness
> of real life with the romantic idealism of one's inner child. You might draw parallels between

- Come, my darling sit with me,
- Where else would you want to be?
- It breaks my heart that I made you cry,
- But despite it all you know I try.

+ You’ve been here in this room all day,
+ All this time, just a touch away ---
+ But there is a wall between us now
+ I’d break it down if I only knew how.

- Perhaps that teardrop left a trace
- As it slid down silent upon your face,
- A moment’s hurt, an agonized look ---
- What price to give back what I took?

+ My heart stood still as I saw your pain,
+ Will anything ever be the same again?
+ Maybe tomorrow will wash this clear,
+ Maybe we don’t have to come back here?
